# RFF-for-GP  

## About The Project  
A Python implementation of Gaussian Processes (GP) with Random Fourier Features (RFF) for scalable approximation.  

## Features  
- Implements Gaussian Process (GP) regression.  
- Uses Random Fourier Features (RFF) for computational efficiency.  
- Supports different kernel functions.  

## Installation  
Ensure **Python 3.7+** is installed with the required packages:  
```bash
pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib


## Usage  
The functions to test and plot results are in `GP_test (2).py`.  
Variable selection implementation is in `GP_no_scheme.py`.  
No modifications are needed to run the simulations.
