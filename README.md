# RFF-for-GP
# About The Project
A Python implementation of Gaussian Processes (GP) with Random Fourier Features (RFF) for scalable approximation.

## Features
- Implements Gaussian Process (GP) regression.
- Uses Random Fourier Features (RFF) for computational efficiency.
- Supports different kernel functions.


## Installation
Ensure **Python 3.7+** is installed with the required packages:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib
